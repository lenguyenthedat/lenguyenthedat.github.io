      "reference": "Dat was our first hire into Data Science. His interview task code set the tone: he first submitted solutions in Haskell, then taught himself Python in 3 days and resubmitted in Python.   He was incredibly productive from the outset. In 2 hours, he taught himself Amazon Redshift then built a data warehouse which allowed the email team to integrate their mailing solution provider seamlessly in a matter of days. He still manages this data warehouse on his own, in his spare time; rebranded Redcat, it feeds all the products built by Data Science as well as other analysts in the company and contains a copy of practically all the company's data, all the way to customer service call recordings.   He also wrote the recommendation algorithms currently running on the site, once again having not done this kind of work before. I learnt a lot just from listening to him explaining his R&D approach for that project.   Working with Dat is always the same experience: you give him a high level spec, sit back, and the product comes back quickly, showing an understanding of your actual problem instead of the one you thought you had. I've also noticed him fixing import issues due to third parties (since his own code is rock solid) at 3 in the morning, and turning up cheerfully the next day as if nothing had happened. There's evidence of his work in all departments from Marketing to Buying, and everybody agrees that he has become a key part of the company's success and growth.   It is not often that you can say that you feel privileged to have worked with somebody. It was most definitely a real, rare honour to have had the chance to work with Dat, and I always saw our relationship less as employee/employer and more as having the chance to rent extraordinary talent at cut throat pricing and getting a fantastic return on investment. Even if he studied at the Other Place."
