Hi there, if you are one of the 5 random people who have been reading my blog here, you probably realized that it has not been updated for over a year now.
I'm, in fact, still writing, but have decided to fully move to medium to save my time, to focus more on the content of my blog. So, if you are still interested, here is the link to my Medium page: [lenguyuenthedat@medium](https://medium.com/@lenguyenthedat/latest).

Anyhow, below are some of the articles that I've written that was not re-posted here:
