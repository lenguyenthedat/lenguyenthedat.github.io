**Disclaimer:** I have no relationship with Uber, any Taxi company, or any Uber and Taxi employee whatsoever. I'm simply someone who is curious with new technologies and uses their services from time to time.

During the last few years, I've seen and heard so many thing about Uber. While a number of them are positive, a large amount of them are not, especially in the last few days, it's become suprisingly unpleasant. To name a few lately:

- [A rider in Vietnam who was charged 350k VND ~ 17 USD when an Uber driver claimed that the rider's wife puked inside the car](http://kenh14.vn/xa-hoi/khach-di-taxi-uber-viet-nam-bi-tru-350-nghin-trong-tai-khoan-vi-bi-cho-la-da-non-tren-xe-2015062407291924.chn)
- [Paris cabbies show their dislike of uber with burning tires.](http://www.wired.com/2015/06/paris-cabbies-show-dislike-uber-burning-tires/)

## So, what is Uber?
Surprisingly and sadly, most people doesn't quite get it because they were so used to taking a taxi for all those years. Uber is a technology company, not a taxi company at all. *They own no car nor any driver*. In short, they provide a platform that connect drivers to cars and to riders through an app. They earn revenues by being the middle man with their platform, by being the challenger to a monopolistic market (think Whatsapp vs telcos).

If you have been noticing, this is actually a hot trend nowadays to provide such platform. Look at Ebay, they earn money by providing a platform to connect sellers and buyers - they do not have a warehouse or any goods to sell at all. Another two examples are Airbnb and Spotify.

## Is Uber even legal?
- Short answer: Yes.
- Long answer: Just think about it: last year, Uber has been evaluated to worth more than [$41 Billion](http://www.wsj.com/articles/ubers-new-funding-values-it-at-over-41-billion-1417715938). Where does that money come from? Definitely not from their profit / revenue, I doubt if they are making any profit as of last year "ripping off" their customers. It simply came from investors - millionairs / billionairs - who are statistically much smarter and more experienced than we are, with huge amount of money, constantly looking for grow more every day. Do you think they would invest billions of dollars into Uber without knowing if it's absolutely legal?

Still not convinced yet? Look at Singapore, where law is known to be taken seriously than most of other countries in the world. Look how their leader [talked about Uber and Grabtaxi](http://www.pmo.gov.sg/mediacentre/transcript-speech-prime-minister-lee-hsien-loong-founders-forum-smart-nation-singapore).

Sure, there are a few countries that have banned Uber but imho, I think they either don't quite understand what it is, or there are corruptions somewhere in their government :).

## Is this good for us?
Yes it is. It's good for us because: For so many years, taxi service has been a monopoly market in most countries in the world. Taxi companies have no rival - except between themselves, who are basically offering the same thing for the same amount of money - who knows how they have agreed with each other on fixing the price? Uber came in as a new, young, and extremely aggresive player to challenge those services. The taxi companies now either need to evolve to be better and smarter, or, simply lower their prices substancially. Of course, unless you are working for a taxi company, or allergic to changes, it would be a good news for you. Remember: you are not forced to chose any service now.

- As a rider, you get to (statistically) pay less for a better ride, more polite and friendly driver. The risk of getting in a dirty, smelly, unsafe car with bad drivers who would rip you off if you do not pay attention (or even so), or simply lost something just reduced significantly simply because of the automated rating system.

- As a driver, you get to earn extra money by providing your service as a professional in your free time, whenever you want to, for more polite, friendly, and happier customers.

## Conclusions
I'm honestly pretty happy with the fact that Uber has been established in Vietnam and Singapore. I'm even happier and proud that my dad - in his sixties can use Uber perfectly fine and even explained Uber to his friend and co-workers who are much younger than him. I don't think Uber is flawless though - there are still many problems they need to solve everyday:

- I've seen and experienced a few loopholes that get abused by the drivers.
- I've Uber's customer serive agents sometimes handle the situation poorly.
- I hope they would improve the "demand and supply" problem in some part of the country they operate on.
