This is my OS X setup. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

## Alfred v2 - [alfredapp.com](https://www.alfredapp.com/)
I have been using Alfred for a good while as a Spotlight alternative. Alfred v2 gives a lot of customization and features for the end user comparing to OS X's spotlight.

## Divvy - [mizage.com/divvy](http://mizage.com/divvy/)
Simply for windows management.

## USB Overdrive - [www.usboverdrive.com](http://www.usboverdrive.com/USBOverdrive)
USB Overdrive gives me ability to remove mouse's acceleration and customizing mouse buttons.

## OS X Keyboard Shortcuts
I'm thankful this was built-in into OS X, allowing me to set hotkeys for any OS X application.

## Spark for Mac - [macupdate.com/app/mac/14352/spark](http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/14352/spark)
If you use any generic external keyboard that doesn't have "Mac" shortcuts, this will be very handy.

## HomeBrew - [brew.sh](http://brew.sh/)
The one and only OS X's package manager.

## Coloring my terminal
{% highlight bash %}
# Put these into your ~/.bash_profile
export TERM="xterm-color"
PS1="\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[01;34m\] \w \$\[\033[00m\] "
export CLICOLOR='true'
export LSCOLORS="gxfxcxdxbxegedabagacad"
export GREP_OPTIONS='--color=auto'
{% endhighlight %}

## Git shortcuts - [madebynathan.com](http://madebynathan.com/2011/10/19/git-shortcuts-like-youve-never-seen-before/)
Once installed and used these, I can't never go back.
