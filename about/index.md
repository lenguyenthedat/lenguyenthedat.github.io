- I am a Data Science enthusiast and also a Data Engineer by training. I design and build end-to-end data products (data pipelines, data warehouses, recommendation systems, predictive models, reporting, and visualizations).

- In Oct 2010, I received my [MSc degree in Computer Science](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/admissions/grad/MSc_in_Computer_Science) from the University of Oxford - my interests included programming, algorithm, statistics, and information retrieval.

- Feel free to drop me a message if you want to talk data :).
