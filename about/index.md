I was born and raised in Hồ Chí Minh city, Vietnam until I was 20, spent 3 years studying in the United Kingdom, and have been working in Singapore ever since graduated.

I am a computer scientist:

- I love programming, new technologies, being challenged, and building useful products.
- I am particularly interested in solving data science and mathematics problems.

I am also a [freelance photographer](https://www.flickr.com/photos/intoth3rainbow/):

- I like taking portraits of friends, landscapes and architectures.
- Occasionally, I do take wedding / pre-wedding photos for quite a number of my friends.
