I am a computer scientist:

- I graduated from the [University of Nottingham](http://www.nott.ac.uk/) with a Bachelor's degree in 2009, and from the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/) with a Master's degree in 2010, both in Computer Science.
- I love programming, new technologies, being challenged, and building useful products.
- I am particularly interested in solving data science and mathematics problems.
- I am currently a Data Scientist as well as Head of Data Warehouse at [ZALORA Group](http://worldwide.zalora.com/).

I am also a freelance photographer:

- I started taking pictures with my Nikon DSLR(s) since 2009.
- I like taking portraits of friends, landscapes and architectures.
- Occasionally, I do take wedding / pre-wedding photos for quite a number of my friends.
