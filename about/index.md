- I am a Data Science enthusiast who enjoys building end-to-end data products (data infrastructure, recommendation systems, and predictive models)

- I am also particularly interested in security and fraud prevention (from social engineering attack, consumer facing products, and online payment)

- I mainly use: Python, SQL, Shell Script, Haskell, Git, Tableau, Docker, and Amazon Web Services

- Feel free to drop me a message if you want to talk data or security :)
